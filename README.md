Hospital Database README
The objective of this project is to develop a database system for managing hospital activities. The database is expected to be efficient, user-friendly, and capable of handling large volumes of data related to patients, doctors, medical records, appointments, and departments. This project meets the requirements set by the client, including storing detailed patient information, appointment scheduling, medical history, and departmental data.

The project demonstrates expertise in using database objects such as stored procedures, user-defined functions (UDFs), views, triggers, joins, SQL queries, and nested queries. The database adheres to the third normal form (3NF), involving the creation of multiple tables, relationships, constraints, and permissions.

The database is designed using Transact-SQL (T-SQL) and developed within Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
